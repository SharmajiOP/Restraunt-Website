# Deployment Guide

Instructions for deploying The Connaught Restaurant Website to GitHub and hosting platforms.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Your repository is now properly organized with:
- ✅ All 54 images organized in `images/` folder
- ✅ 8 HTML pages with updated paths
- ✅ Professional documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- ✅ Proper .gitignore file
- ✅ Clean Git history with meaningful commit

## 🚀 GitHub Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Existing GitHub Repository

If you already have a GitHub repository, connect it:

```bash
# Add your existing GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

# Push to GitHub (this will overwrite your existing repository with the improved version)
git push -u origin master --force
```

### 2. Create New GitHub Repository (Alternative)

If you want to create a fresh repository:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `connaught-restaurant` or `restaurant-website`
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Copy the repository URL and run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
git push -u origin master
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- Ensure case sensitivity matches (PNG vs png)

### Broken Links

- Check navigation menu links in each HTML file

### Git Issues
